Services
========

Lando provides a way to easily specify the services and tooling your app needs via `.lando.yml`. You can use services to replace the loading of Docker compose files, although you can use both.

> #### Info::Docker compose files are loaded first
>
> If you want to load Docker compose files **and** use services, you should note that compose files are loaded first. This means that depending on how you name things, your services could override things set in your compose files.
